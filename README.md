1. Use the database to create a XML file that transfers everything from the Weeks and Item tables.
2. Write the XSD to validate the XML
3. Format the XML page using XSLT to convert it to HTML. (Must have a repeating group within a repeating group, at least 5 data elements, and use a table to align at least some of the elements.)
